## Introduction
Our team at DDSAnalytics was tasked by Frito Lay to develop the company's first application of data science for talent management. Specific tasks achieved in this analysis:

1. Identification of top 3 factors that lead to turnover

2. Creation of model to predict employee attrition

3. Creation of model to predict employee monthly income

4. Exploration of any other trends that we find in the data

The files in this repo are organized as such:

1. CaseStudy2-data.csv - The data that the models were built and tested using
2. CaseStudy2CompSet No Attrition.csv - Data with no attrition variable, used for testing our classification model
3. CaseStudy2CompSet No Salary.csv - Data with no Monthly Income variable, used for testing our regression model

The Project2.Rmd file contains the code and analysis that was performed during this project. This file also contains the link to the youtube video. 

The Project2.html file is the html output of the Project2.Rmd file. 

The Project2.pptx file contains the slides used for the youtube video. 

The Case2PredictionsLarsen Salary.csv file contains the predictions of salary for each ID from the CaseStudy2CompSet No Salary.csv file. 

The Case2PredictionsLarsen Attrition.csv file contains the predictions of attrition for each ID from the CaseStudy2CompSet No Attrition.csv file.
